VISUAL C++ REDISTRIBUTABLES

The following errors:

- Memory Could Not Be Read
- Memory Could Not Be Written
- Missing MSVCP.dll File
- Missing VCRUNTIME.dll File

... can be caused by errors with Visual C++ Redistributables.
They can sometimes be fixed by:

- Reregistering the MSVCP files (using the script), or
- Reinstalling the Visual C++ Redistributables

First try reregistering and restarting your computer. If that
does not work, uninstall your current redistributables (from
Settings/Apps), and then download the latest x64 and x86 
packages from the provided links and reinstall them.
